Problem-sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
         priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> q;
        for(int i:nums){
            q.push(i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        nums[i] = q.top();
        q.pop();
        }
     for (int color : nums) {
        cout << color << " ";
    }
    }
};
